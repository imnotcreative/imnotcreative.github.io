		<p>Now you may think "Why is Neil Armstrong a hero to procrastinators? he is like one of the least lazy people on earth he literally was the first person on the moon" and while that may be true, what people do not know about Neil Armstrong, he was probably one of the best procrastinators on earth. For example, his real name was Nathaneil, but once he was in kindergarten his first assignment was to write his name, so he painfully picked up his pencil, and powered through and wrote a fine N, and before he started with the A he said to himself "I could do a way better N", so he erased it and did another one, and another, and another, until finally he wrote the finest N you could ever imagine. yes it was amazing, but the he had little time to do the rest of his name (a perfect example of a working procrastinator), but then he thought "Maybe if I just write the last 3 letters if my name the teacher wont notice" so then he did so and thought "that was a lot easier, that was only 4 letters instead of god knows how many" and hence how the name Neil. Another good example is actually the story of him going to the moon, he once told a teacher of his he couldn't do a final project for one of his high school classes, he told the teacher he was sick but really he found a funny video on YouTube of a cat playing a piano, so there he was way in the future and 38 years of age when he got a call from his teacher saying "you need to hand in your project Neil" Neil was distraught, how on earth can I out that much effort into that, so he did what anyone would do, he told his teacher he can't he's needs to go to the moon. the teachers said "BULL(logne), you have to hand it in in a week" so Neil again did what anyone would do. he ran to the moon. In fact, his first words on the moon weren't "One small step for man, one large step for man kind" it was actually a radio in to his teacher saying "I'm sorry Mr.Sandersmith I am on the moon, can I get an extension?" and of coarse he did... and then still didn't do it.<p>

		<p>George Lucas, Director, procrastinator, visionary. You see, George Lucas has procrastinated in a way nobody thought was possible, he procrastinated writing the first 3 star wars and got away with it and not only that but then did the last 3 because he was so behind!!!! imagine such an ability... when he chose to do that, he won his way into the T.I.P.A and and our hearts. yes it was amazing, writing one of the most beloved films on earth. Now unfortunately the ones he procrastinated on turned out to be awful... but still makes you think... what a talented man. we all should learn a thing or 2 from good ole' George here, for he is truly one of T.I.P.A's greatest treasure.<p>

			<li>Jeff</li>

		<p>Jeff is probably one of the best procrastinators, why? because he invented procrastination. in 1886 he was pressured by his father, a great inventor, to become an inventor also, to the point where his father said "if you don't invent something with in a year, you will be kicked out". But Jeff didn't want to, he wanted to do nothing, so he came up with an idea. his father kept saying "YOU MUST INVENT SOMETHING" and Jeff would simply respond "I will", which is now known as lying procrastination. such a simple answer. Jeff did this for months and months before his father finally caught on. Once he did though Jeff had another plan, Jeff said "after this episode of star trek" (which as you know was the hit tv show of 1886), which is now known as the watching procrastinator. and the he said "I'll have a snack", the eating procrastinator. then he said "it's already 3 o'clock, I have no time", the procrastinating procrastinator. and then he said "I need to take a nap first" the sleeping procrastinator. but soon Jeff's father started to catch on to Jeff's routine, and demanded that he invent something or he's kicked out. now Jeff only had a week left in his year, so he tried one more thing, a hail mary, a last resort, a shot in the dark. He started panicking, he freaked out, he began running around scared saying "HOW AM I TO INVENT SOMETHING IN A WEEK I'M SCREWED" and spent all his time doing that instead of actually inventing something, also known as the panicking procrastinator. in which his father called off the deal for Jeff's health. Ironically though Jeff became an inventor right at the beginning, the inventor of procrastination.
