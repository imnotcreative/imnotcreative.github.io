		<h2>The 6 Types Of Procrastinators</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Lying Procrastinators</li>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="Procrastination-Cycle.jpg" alt="A cycle where someone keeps saying I'll do it tomorrow"></li>
				<li>The lying procrastinator is probably the most common one of the 6 types. it is simply where you say "I will do it" "I'll do it tomorrow" "Sometime later". Unfortunatly it is also the least effective, for the lying never actually gives you an excuse, so at some point you will be unfortunatly forced to do it</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Watching Procrastinators</li>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="images(1).jpg" alt="A meme saying Essay to do, watches sponge bob square pants episode about procrastination instead"></li>
				<li>The Watching procrastinator is also very common, it is the type of procrastinator who says "after this episode" and then continues to watch it. this method is better but still not an amazing type of procrastination, for it doesn't take long for your parents to figure out what you're doing.<li>
			</ul>
			<li>Eating Procrastinators</li>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="images(2).jpg" alt="A meme saying I need to eat lunch before I do this so I can have energy, after lunch, sleeps"></li>
				<li>The eating procrastinator is a very effective tool of wasting time, for you see no one can argue that you're hungry, how can they know? so you may eat a little bit, and then a little bit more, and a little bit more, until you eat so much you can't do any more work. this is smart cause it's hard to call you out on it and you also get a meal also.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Sleeping Procrastinators</li>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="images(3).jpg" alt="A meme saying exams are coming up, better nap first"></li>
				<li>The sleeping procrastinator takes naps all the time</li>
