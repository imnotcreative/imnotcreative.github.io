		<p>Now you may think "Why is Niel Armstrong a hero to procrastinators? he is like one of the least lazy people on earth he literally was the first person on the moon" and while that may be true, what people do not know about Niel Armstrong, he was probably one of the best procrastinators on earth. For example, his real name was Nathaniel, but once he was in kindergarten his first assignment was to write his name, so he painfully picked up his pencil, and powered through and wrote a fine N, and before he started with the A he said to himself "I could do a way better N", so he erased it and did another one, and another, and another, until finally he wrote the finest N you could ever imagine. yes it was amazing, but the he had little time to do the rest of his name (a perfect example of a working procrastinator), but then he thought "Maybe if I just write the last 3 letters if my name the teacher wont notice" so then he did so and thought "that was alot easier, that was only 4 letters instead of god knows how many" and hence how the name Niel. Another good example is actually the story of him going to the moon, he once told a teacher of his he couldn't do a final project for one of his high school classes, he told the teacher he was sick but really he found a funny video on youtube of a cat playing a piano, so there he was way in the future and 38 years of age when he got a call from his teacher saying "you need to hand in your project niel" niel was distraught, how on earth can I out that much effort into that, so he did what anyone would do, he told his teacher he can't he's needs to go to the moon. the teachers said "BULL(logne), you have to hand it in in a week" so niel again did what anyone would do. he ran to the moon. infact, his first words on the moon weren't "One small step for man, one large step for man kind" it was actually a radio in to his teacher saying "I'm sorry Mr. Sandersmith I am on the moon, can I get an extesion?" and of coarse he did... and then still didn't do it.<p>

		<p>George Lucas, Director, procrastinator, visionary. You see, George Lucas has procrastinated in a way nobody thought was possible, he procrastinated writing the first 3 starwars and got away with it and not only that but then did the last 3 because he was so behind!!!! imagine such an ability... when he chose to do that, he won his way into the T.I.P.A and and our hearts. yes it was amazing, writing one of the most beloved films on earth. Now unfortunately the ones he procrastinated on turned out to be aweful... but still makes you think... what a talented man. we all should learn a thing or 2 from good ole' George here, for he is truly one of T.I.P.A's greatest treasure.<p>
